BEGINNER TUTORIAL
==================

*The aim of this respository is to provide a simple example (talker/listener) about how to 
create and deploy a ROS package in an embedded system using the meta-ros project.*


The code illustrates how to create a simple talker/listener ros package written in **python**.
The package will be cross-compiled using bitbake and deployed in an embedded system
that uses the meta-ros project (https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros).

CROSS COMPILATION
=================

Recipes are available at https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/tree/master/recipes.



USAGE
=====

The easiest way to use the code is to get the code `git clone https://github.com/vmayoral/beginner_tutorials.git` and the install the through `opkg install beginner_tutorials/ipkg/beginner_tutorials*.ipkg`. (This has been compiled for the **beaglebone** in the Angstrom distribution)

An alternative method is to cross-compile the code by yourself following these instructions:

* Set up an Angstrom distribution in your embedded platform. Some basic instructions about how to do to accomplish this are given at the `README.md`
of https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros.

* `git clone` the beagle-ros project (https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros.git) in some place such as `/tmp`

* add `recipes/*` to the `meta-ros/recipes-ros/`: `cp -r /path/to/beagle-ros/recipes/* /path/to/meta-ros/recipes-ros/`. This step adds the recipe required to cross-compile this code inside of the meta-ros code structure.

* `bitbake beginner_tutorials` to create an ipkg of the ROS package.

* copy `/path/to/the/package/beginner_tutorials*.ipkg` to your embedded platform and install it using `opkg install beginner_tutorials*.ipkg`

* run the package using `rosrun beginner_tutorials talker.py` or `rosrun beginner_tutorials listerner.py`

HOW TO REPLICATE
===================

* Set up an Angstrom distribution in your embedded platform. Some basic instructions about how to do to accomplish this are given at the `README.md`
of https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros.

* Create a ROS package the usual way (`catkin_create_pkg`).

* Edit the CMakeLists so that it'll deploy files according to your needs (check http://ros.org/wiki/catkin/CMakeLists.txt).

* Upload the code of the package to a github repository.

* Create a bitbake recipe such as the one provided for this example available at https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/blob/master/recipes/beginner-tutorials/beginner-tutorials_git.bb

* Put the recipe in the meta-ros file structure (check USAGE instructions for an example)

* cross-compile and install the package as explained in the USAGE section
