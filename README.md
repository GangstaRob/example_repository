BEGINNER_TUTORIAL
==================

*The aim of this respository is to provide a simple example (talker/listener) about how to 
create and deploy a ROS package in an embedded system using the meta-ros project.*


The code illustrates how to create a simple talker/listener ros package written in **python**.
The package will be cross-compiled using bitbake and deployed in an embedded system
that uses the meta-ros project (https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros).

USAGE
=====

* Set up an Angstrom distribution in your embedded platform. Some basic instructions about how to do to accomplish this are given at the `README.md`
of https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros.

* `git clone` the beagle-ros project (https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros.git) at the `sources/` directory of your Angstrom installation.

* Add the beagle-ros package to the Angstrom packages (COMPLETE)

* `bitbake beginner_tutorials` to create an ipkg of the ROS package.

* copy `beginner_tutorials*.ipkg` to your embedded platform and install it using `opkg install beginner_tutorials*.ipkg`

HOW TO REPLICATE
===================

* Set up an Angstrom distribution in your embedded platform. Some basic instructions about how to do to accomplish this are given at the `README.md`
of https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros.

* Create a ROS package the usual way (`catkin_create_pkg`).

* Upload the code of the package to a github repository

* Create a bitbake recipe such as the one provided for this example available at https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/blob/master/recipes/beginner-tutorials_git.bb

* COMPLETE
